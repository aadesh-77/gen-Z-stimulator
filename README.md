# Social Media Simulator

## Overview
A **Social Media Simulator** is a tool designed to replicate the interactions and dynamics of real-world social media platforms. These simulators serve as an educational and experimental platform for understanding user engagement, content sharing, and the growth of social networks. They are particularly valuable for researchers, developers, marketers, and cloud resource managers aiming to optimize system efficiency and scalability.

This project focuses on building an advanced social media simulator that incorporates modern data structures, user-friendly interfaces, and real-time analytics. It has the potential to provide insights into social media trends, resource management, and collaborative cloud-based solutions.

## Objectives
1. **Understanding Social Dynamics**:
   - Simulate user interactions such as likes, shares, comments, and connections.
   - Analyze trends in content virality and network growth.

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Use efficient data structures to manage and allocate cloud resources dynamically.
   - Test scalability under increasing user loads and activities.

3. **Educational Tool**:
   - Provide a hands-on platform for students and researchers to understand graph theory, network analytics, and cloud infrastructure.

4. **Testing Environment**:
   - A safe platform to test new features or algorithms without affecting live social media systems.

## Key Features
### 1. **Graph Visualization**
   - **Dynamic Graph Layouts**: Represent users as nodes and their interactions as edges.
   - **Customization Options**: Change node colors, edge styles, and add labels dynamically.

### 2. **Tooltips and Analytics**
   - Tooltips display user information, interaction statistics, or content metadata on hover.
   - Analyze and display metrics such as:
     - Node degree (number of connections).
     - Content virality index.
     - Shortest path between users.

### 3. **Data Import and Export**
   - Import graph data from external files (e.g., CSV, JSON).
   - Export graph visualizations as images (e.g., PNG) or structured data for further analysis.

### 4. **Real-Time User Interaction**
   - Add, delete, or modify nodes and edges through GUI interactions.
   - Drag-and-drop functionality to reposition nodes.

### 5. **Cloud Resource Optimization**
   - Simulate resource allocation scenarios for cloud-based systems.
   - Evaluate algorithms for dynamic load balancing and efficient data distribution.

### 6. **Advanced Functionalities**
   - **Community Detection**: Identify closely connected groups within the network.
   - **Pathfinding**: Highlight shortest paths or suggest alternate connections.
   - **Collaboration Features**: Allow multiple users to edit the graph simultaneously.
